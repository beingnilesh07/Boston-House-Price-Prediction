# Boston House Price Prediction

Utilizing the Boston Housing Dataset, this project builds a machine learning model to forecast house prices. The model will learn relationships between property characteristics, location, and price, ultimately offering insights into the factors influencing real estate value in the area.

# Attributes:-<br>
**CRIM (Per Capita Crime Rate)**:- The per capita crime rate in the neighborhood.<br>
**ZN (Proportion of Residential Land Zoned for Large Lots)**:- The proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq. ft.<br>
**INDUS (Proportion of Non-Retail Business Acres)**:- The proportion of non-retail business acres per town.<br>
**CHAS (Charles River Dummy Variable)**:- A binary variable indicating whether the Charles River bounds the tract (1 if bounded, 0 otherwise).<br>
**NOX (Nitric Oxides Concentration)**:- Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).<br>
**RM (Average Number of Rooms per Dwelling)**:- The average number of rooms per dwelling.<br>
**AGE (Proportion of Owner-Occupied Units Built Prior to 1940)**:- The proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.<br>
**DIS (Weighted Distances to Employment Centers)**:- Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers.<br>
**RAD (Index of Accessibility to Radial Highways)**:- An index representing accessibility to radial highways.<br>
**TAX (Full-Value Property Tax Rate per $10,000)**:- The full-value property tax rate per $10,000.<br>
**PTRATIO (Pupil-Teacher Ratio)**:- The pupil-teacher ratio by town.<br>
**B (1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the Proportion of Black Residents)**:- A measure of the proportion of Black residents adjusted for an offset.<br>
**LSTAT (Percentage of Lower Status of the Population)**:- The percentage of lower-status residents in the population.<br>
**MEDV (Median Value of Owner-Occupied Homes)**:- The median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s (Target Variable).<br>

# Objective:
The model should be able to reliably predict prices for new, unseen houses, which is crucial for real-world application. Techniques like train-test splitting and cross-validation are employed to ensure the model generalizes well
